## Description
This is the tech blog application i have created. When visiting the site, you are taken to a homepage that will show all existing blog posts. when you try to click on them, you will be forwarded to the login or sign up page. when you sign up your credentials will be saved for later login ability. after log in you will be brought back to the home page and from there you can click on the blog posts to see if any comments have been made. The postings and the comments will have user information related to who created it. if you look at the nav bar the login signup page has been switched to the users profile(dashboard) page link. when you enter the profile page you are greeted by all the blog posts you have made, aswell as the button to edit post. after the edit button is clicked a delete, cancel and update button is produced. after you make any changes the update button will update your post and hide the edit functions. unfortunately the changes arent made immedietly, but on page reload. other wise the delete button will delete and take the post right off the page.
